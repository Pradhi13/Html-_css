An electric motor is an electrical machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. The reverse of this is the conversion of mechanical energy into electrical energy and is done by an electric generator.In normal motoring mode, most electric motors operate through the interaction between an electric motor's magnetic field and winding currents to generate force within the motor. In certain applications, such as in the transportation industry with traction motors, electric motors can operate in both motoring and generating or braking modes to also produce electrical energy from mechanical energy</section>

	       	<section class="content"> 
In non-slip energy recovery systems WRIM is usually used for motor starting but can be used to vary load speed.

Whereas induction and synchronous motor drives are typically with either six-step or sinusoidal waveform output,. current waveform; the behavior of both sinusoidal and trapezoidal PM machines is however identical in terms of their fundamental aspects.
In variable-speed operation WRIM is used in slip energy recovery and double-fed induction machine applications.
A cage winding is a shorted-circuited squirrel-cage rotor, a wound winding is connected externally through slip rings.</section>
